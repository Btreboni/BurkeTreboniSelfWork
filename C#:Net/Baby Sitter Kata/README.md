This repo will serve as a host for the Baby Sitter Coding Kata

Babysitter Kata
Background
This kata simulates a babysitter working and getting paid for one night. The rules are pretty straight forward.

The babysitter:

starts no earlier than 5:00PM
leaves no later than 4:00AM
gets paid $12/hour from start-time to bedtime
gets paid $8/hour from bedtime to midnight
gets paid $16/hour from midnight to end of job
gets paid for full hours (no fractional hours)
Feature
As a babysitter
In order to get paid for 1 night of work
I want to calculate my nightly charge

Developer Notes:

This solution was written using C#/.NetCore, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Please follow the instructions below to launch the solutions.

When you pull this repo, you should not have to add any packages to start the C# program. Open the BackEnd solution using Visual Studio, Clean, and build it.

Once you launch the solution (I would use Chrome), note the url address in your address bar. You will need to open FrontEnd/BabySitterKata/js/index.js in a code editor (I use Visual Studio code, but you can also download Sublime, or Atom). You will need to copy the URL from your browser, copy and paste over "**YourURLAddressGoesHere**" on line 45 of index.js, uncomment it out, and comment out the url below.

The backend already accounts for Cors, so you shouldn't have any cross-origin issues. 

Thank you for checking out my program!
